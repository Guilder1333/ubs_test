1. I suppose having maven dependencies doesn't count as manual download.
2. Added row numbers for easier understanding of row number.
3. Rules are made flexible for a little bit.
4. Games usually have different kind of code quality, targeting better performance. As a result exceptions are usually avoided. So code was written having some kind of API in mind.
5. Of course, for a game would be good to have an AI player and a network player.
6. Add replay player for test purposes. It reads input from file to repeat some bugs previously found by players.
7. Add different types of UI for different platforms.
8. Add integration tests.
9. Maybe modules for different kinds of implementations.
10. Maybe separate backend from UI, if there are such requirements.
